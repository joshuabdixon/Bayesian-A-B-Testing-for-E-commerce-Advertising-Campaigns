# Bayesian A/B Testing for E-commerce Advertising Campaigns

## Project Overview
This project uses Bayesian methodologies to compare two e-commerce advertising campaigns, focusing on which generates the highest return on investment through customer conversion rates.

## Key Skills and Techniques
- **Bayesian Analysis:** Applied Bayesian thinking to evaluate conversion rates using priors informed by exploratory data analysis.
- **Modeling:** Built a Bayesian model using PyMC, focusing on conversion rates modeled with a Beta distribution.
- **Data Analysis:** Conducted exploratory data analysis to identify key metrics and distributions.
- **Visualisation:** Plotted posterior distributions and used histograms and bar plots to compare campaign performance.
- **Libraries:** `PyMC`, `pandas`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `arviz`.

## Results & Recommendations
- The Bayesian analysis indicates a 75% probability that the control campaign outperforms the variant in conversion rates, though the difference is small.
- Recommended focusing more resources on the control campaign for future advertising efforts.
- Suggests collecting additional data, especially regarding campaign costs, to refine ROI analysis.
